# Sparta_Global_API_Testing_Lab

This project tests an API which returns a plethora of data on UK postcodes. The methods make use of 2 types of call to the API. The first is a get request for a specific postcode which is created from a random postcode generator function. The second is a post request which returns an array of postcode data using the random postcode generator function again. both outputs are tested, using RSpec, for to ensure that the contents of the json data are in the correct format and are in valid partitions.
